  <h3>Salutations</h3>
  <pre>
    I know almost nothing about programming.
    Most of my code are very simplistic and not idomatic

  <h3>My Intrests...</h3>
  
    ..consist almost completly of ASM and C/C++

          <info>primitive program that converts simple keywords into html tags</info>
      <h5>Edit</h5>

      <h5>Space-Death</h5>
          <info>
              Really bad game I made when I tought myself ncurses 
              I actually made 6 varieties:
                 -floato(the og)                                           
                 -floatoo(floato but with an 'o' instead of a rocket ship <=>)
                  -floatr(you remove the obstacles to win)                (v)
                 -floati(the obstacles move randomly)
                 -floatp(prototype originally used to test movement)
                 -floatr(floatoo but without instant death when you touch something)
              <funfact>
              <b>FUN FACT:</b>
                [ I never had any Linux distrubutions other than Rasbian
                  but instead use bash.exe on Windows, in other words, half
                  my programs I can't even use without a VM ]}
              </funfact>
          </info>
      <h5>Fill</h5>
          <info>Creates a that holds as many chars as you want </info>
              <funfact>
              <b>FUN FACT:</b>
                 [ A char is one byte (8 bits,  9 if you count the parity bit)
                   so all you need to do is have one of the cmd args as the
                   number/ of bytes and let a fstream object and for loop do the rest ]
              </funfact>
      <h4>Operating Systems</h4>
         <h5>BadOS</h5> 
            <info>BadOS was made in C++, and says "This is not good" </info>
         <h5>EchOS</h5>
            <info>Written in ASM, it only echoes what you type, thats it</info>
